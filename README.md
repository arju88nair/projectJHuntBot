Project Culminate,
Currently an API structure for culminating news from different sources and curating them.
Done in python

Instead of depending upon  3rd party API service for news feeds, started scrapping RSS feeds my own for independent developing and better confidence on the process


To be done in future:
1) Have to train a model to weed out fake,corrupted,incomplete
2) Multiple spiders for scraping news websites instead of RSS feeds
3) Unified command for simultaneous launch of spiders


This is an alternate working version of ProjectCulminate which is done using Scrapy. Opted for Scrapy because the deployment of [ProjectCulminate](https://github.com/arju88nair/ProjectCulminate) resulted in massive loss in performance.
